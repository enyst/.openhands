# Modify OpenHands (self-modification playbook)

When a user says things like “modify yourself to do X” or “remember this next time”, **don’t jump to editing Python code**.
OpenHands has multiple extensibility layers; choose the *smallest*, *safest*, and *most persistent* mechanism that matches the user’s intent.

This skill is about **persistent** changes that should still apply after the user reloads or restarts the CLI / app. If the user wants behavior only for the current conversation, you don't need the mechanisms in this skill—just follow their instructions directly in this session.

## 0) First: clarify what kind of change the user wants

Clarify the **scope** and **type** of the change (skip questions the user already answered):

1. **Persistence scope**: Should this change apply…
   - for this *repository/workspace*?
   - for *all repos on this machine* (user-global)?
   - for *everyone* (contribution upstream / extensions registry)?
2. **Change type**: Is it primarily…
   - instructions/workflow (“when I ask for X, do Y”)?
   - a safety/policy constraint (“never run rm -rf”, “ask before network calls”)?
   - a new capability/tool integration (GitHub, Jira, internal APIs, etc.)?
   - a bug fix / UI change in the CLI or SDK?
3. **Where do they run OpenHands?**
   - `uv tool install openhands` (tool environment)
   - from a local clone (developer workflow)
   - via a remote runtime / server

Then follow the decision tree below.

## 1) Prefer non-code extensibility (often enough)

### 1.1 Write a skill (AgentSkills / progressive disclosure)

Use when the user wants repeatable expertise/workflows, e.g.:
- “When I say ‘release notes’, use this structure”
- “Here’s how we do migrations in our company”
- “Read the Daytona docs and learn how to use it”

**Where to put it (in priority order):**

1. **Project-local (recommended):** `<repo>/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. **User-global:** `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Notes:
- **Project skills override user + public skills** (same `name`). This is the simplest way to “patch” a public skill locally.
- Add `triggers:` only when you really want automatic activation; prefer **distinctive phrases** to avoid injecting the skill on unrelated messages.

See: [Templates](references/TEMPLATES.md#agentskillsskillmd-template).

### 1.2 Add always-on repo instructions (AGENTS.md)

Use when the user wants **always-applied** guidance for a repository (style, commands, guardrails, conventions):

- Create or edit `<repo>/AGENTS.md` (or model-specific variants like `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` if your environment supports them).
- Put the repo rules there.

This gets loaded at conversation start as “always-on context” (not progressive disclosure).

### 1.3 Add hooks (policy/automation) via `.openhands/hooks.json`

Use when the user wants **enforcement** or **automation** around tool usage, e.g.:
- “Before any git commit, run tests.”
- “Block any command that tries to access prod without approval.”
- “Reject tool calls that write outside the repo.”

Hooks are executed on lifecycle events (like `pre_tool_use`) and can **allow / block / modify** actions.

See: [Hook templates](references/TEMPLATES.md#hookshooksjson-template) and [Hook architecture notes](references/ARCHITECTURE.md#hooks).

### 1.4 Add tools via MCP (`.mcp.json`)

Recommend MCP **only when there is a concrete MCP server to add**:

- The user explicitly asks to “add an MCP server”, **or**
- The user asks for a capability and you can point to an existing MCP server for it (e.g., from that project’s docs / an official MCP server repo).

If there isn’t an MCP server available for what they want, don’t force MCP:
- start with a **skill** (instructions/workflow), or
- if they truly need a new tool, the real work item is to **build or install an MCP server** (or implement a native tool/code change).

MCP server configuration location **depends on the runtime**:

- **OpenHands-CLI** persists MCP servers in `~/.openhands/mcp.json` (or `$OPENHANDS_PERSISTENCE_DIR/mcp.json`).
- **Software Agent SDK skills/plugins** use a **per-skill/per-plugin** `.mcp.json` file located inside the skill/plugin directory.

See: [MCP template](references/TEMPLATES.md#mcp-template).

### 1.5 Package it as a plugin (shareable bundle)

Use when the change should be **portable** across repos or shared with others, and it includes more than just instructions:
- skills + hooks + MCP config together
- optional slash commands and/or specialized agents

Plugins follow the Claude Code-compatible structure, with `.plugin/plugin.json` (or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).

See: [Plugin template](references/TEMPLATES.md#plugin-template) and [Plugin architecture notes](references/ARCHITECTURE.md#plugins).

## 2) When code changes are actually required

Choose the correct codebase / package:

- **CLI UX, TUI widgets, slash commands, config files** → `OpenHands/OpenHands-CLI`
- **Agent runtime logic, skill loading, hooks system, plugin loader, event model** → `OpenHands/software-agent-sdk` → `openhands-sdk`
- **Built-in tools (Terminal, File Editor, Task Tracker, etc.)** → `OpenHands/software-agent-sdk` → `openhands-tools`
- **Workspace mounting / file sync / workspace abstraction** → `OpenHands/software-agent-sdk` → `openhands-workspace`

If you’re not sure, start by reproducing the issue and locating the code path.

## 3) uv development workflows (including `uv tool install openhands`)

- If they run OpenHands from a **local clone**: use `uv sync` + `uv run openhands`.
- If they installed OpenHands via **`uv tool install openhands`**:
  - safest: `uv tool run --from /path/to/OpenHands-CLI openhands`
  - persistent: `uv tool install --force --editable /path/to/OpenHands-CLI`
- If they need to modify the **SDK** while running the CLI, remember: the CLI often **pins exact SDK/tool versions**. Prefer aligning versions; use overrides only for local development.

Details: [Installation modes (`uv tool` vs `uv run`)](references/INSTALLATION_MODES.md).

## 4) What requires a restart to take effect?

- **Skills / AGENTS.md**: loaded at conversation start → usually **start a new conversation** to pick them up. Ask the user to fully restart OpenHands only if needed.
- **Hooks (.openhands/hooks.json)**: loaded when the agent/conversation initializes → ask the user to restart (or create a fresh session) to guarantee reload.
- **Plugins**: loaded when the conversation initializes → ask the user to restart (or create a fresh session) to guarantee reload.
- **Editable Python code (uv tool `--editable` or local `uv run`)**: changes apply the next time the Python process starts → ask the user to restart the CLI/app.

## 5) Verification checklist

After making a “self-modification” change, guide the **user** through verification:

1. Ask the user to start a **fresh conversation** (and restart OpenHands only if needed).
2. If they’re using the **OpenHands CLI TUI**, ask them to type `/skills` to confirm the expected skills/hooks/MCPs are loaded.
3. Ask the user to send a tiny, deterministic **test prompt** that should trigger the new behavior.
4. If it’s a code change, run the smallest relevant test suite (or ask the user to run it) and confirm the behavior matches.
